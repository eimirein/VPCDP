THE "VANILLA PASTEL CRAYON DIGITAL PRODUCT" LICENSE
> Revision from: 2022/12/11
- - -
## What is this?
This is a license for open-source projects that prohibits in use<br>
everything but code, as well as includes a bunch of rules to<br>
control the flow of branches made from the licensed code.
<br><br>
From VPCDP-1.0:
> This is a simplified license that can be provided to <br>
people of any age, as long as comprehended accurately. <br>
Anyone can copy and share this license, but changes to <br>
it, except for "SECTION 0" per product, are not allowed.

## This is not a final version
It's probably not as stable as supposed to be for now,<br>
so contributors are welcome, any help will be appreciated.<br><br>
You can open an issue or pull a request with corrections or/and notices.

## Background information
Initially this license was created for my future project<br>
called "V A äºŒ l l A" (Vanilla or va2.la).<br><br>
But I modified it so it can be utilized by others properly.
