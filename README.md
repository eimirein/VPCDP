## What is this?
This is a license for open-source projects that prohibits in use everything but code,
as well as includes a bunch of rules to control the flow of branches made from the licensed code.

From VPCDP-1.0:
> This is a simplified license that can be provided to people of any age, as long as comprehended accurately.
Anyone can copy and share this license, but changes to it, except for "SECTION 0" per product, are not allowed.

## This is not a final version
As for now it's, probably, not as stable as supposed to be, so contributors are welcome,
any help will be appreciated.

You can open an issue or pull a request with corrections or/and notices.

## Background information
Initially this license was created for my project called "V A äºŒ l l A" (Vanilla or va2.la).

But I modified it so it can be utilized by others properly.
